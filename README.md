# divideConquerChallenge
This program is an algorithm challenge focused on using a divide and conquer algorithm. 

Problem: Given two sets of points {a.0, ..., a.n} and {b.0, ..., b.n} plotted on the lines y=1 and y=2, respectfully. The challenge is as follows: if the points a.n and b.n are connected respectfully, how many intersecting lines will exist? 

With a divide and conquer algorithm, a running time of O(n*log(n)) is possible. 

Remarks: No points are placed at the same point. each point will be represented on it's respective horizontal axis via a positive integer location. 

Input style:
